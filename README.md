# Hey! I'm Hannah ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜Š

Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

## About Me
Iâ€™m a software developer with a background in soil microbiology, and Iâ€™ve just completed an intensive full-time training at Dev Academy (Autumn/Winter 2025 cohort). My journey into tech grew out of a desire to understand and regenerate soil ecosystems. I spent years fascinated by the incredible complexity and potential that the soil holds, and how microscopic life shapes the health of our land.  But I realised I wanted to do more than analyse. I wanted to build creative, practical tools that could actually drive change.

During my time at Dev Academy, I haved remembered my love for collaborating with others ant thinking creatively. I especially thrive in start-up environments and small teams, where creativity, agility, and close teamwork bring ideas to life. 

Transitioning into tech has been such a fun experience. Starting from zero just 9 weeks ago, Iâ€™ve been amazed by what myself and the other students have been able to build in such a short amount of time. Itâ€™s given me the confidence to dive into this industry and immerse myself in some cool tech.
