Hey! I'm Hannah ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜Š

Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

# About Me

Iâ€™m a software developer who recently completed full-time training at Dev Academy (Autumn/Winter 2025 cohort). Before diving into coding, I was deeply interested in soil microbiology and understanding it for soil regeneration â€” and Iâ€™m excited to blend science and technology to explore new possibilities at this intersection. I also love collaborating in start up environments and small teams, where creativity, agility and close teamwork bring ideas to life. 

# Skills & Technologies
**JavaScript / TypeScript**

**React / Node.js**

**Full-stack web development**

**Collaborative teamwork in small teams and startups**

**Scientific data analysis (soil microbiology background)**

# Letâ€™s Connect!
Iâ€™m always open to collaboration, being mentored as I find my feet in this new industry, or chatting about SciTech!
